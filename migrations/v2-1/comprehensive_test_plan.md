# Comprehensive Migration Testing Plan

## 🎯 Testing Objectives
Ensure the V2 migration is production-ready by validating:
- Data integrity and accuracy
- User experience preservation
- System performance and reliability
- Rollback capabilities
- Edge case handling

## 📋 Testing Phases

### Phase 1: Data Integrity Testing ✅ (In Progress)
**Status**: Partially Complete
**Goal**: Verify all data is migrated correctly

#### 1.1 Schema Validation
- [x] Table structure matches between V1 and V2
- [x] Column types and constraints preserved
- [x] Foreign key relationships maintained

#### 1.2 Data Accuracy Testing
- [ ] User profile data accuracy
- [ ] Session history preservation
- [ ] Drill preferences and groups
- [ ] Progress tracking data
- [ ] Authentication tokens and passwords

#### 1.3 Relationship Integrity
- [ ] User → Sessions relationships
- [ ] User → Preferences relationships
- [ ] User → Drill Groups relationships
- [ ] User → Progress History relationships

### Phase 2: User Experience Testing ❌ (Needed)
**Status**: Not Started
**Goal**: Ensure users can seamlessly continue using the app

#### 2.1 Authentication Testing
- [ ] Apple user login with migrated credentials
- [ ] Android user login (unchanged)
- [ ] Password reset functionality
- [ ] Session token validation

#### 2.2 Data Access Testing
- [ ] User can view their training history
- [ ] Drill preferences are preserved
- [ ] Progress tracking works correctly
- [ ] Custom drill groups are accessible

#### 2.3 App Functionality Testing
- [ ] Training session creation
- [ ] Drill completion tracking
- [ ] Progress updates
- [ ] Settings and preferences

### Phase 3: Performance Testing ❌ (Needed)
**Status**: Not Started
**Goal**: Ensure migration can handle production load

#### 3.1 Migration Performance
- [ ] Full dataset migration time
- [ ] Memory usage during migration
- [ ] Database connection stability
- [ ] Concurrent user handling

#### 3.2 Post-Migration Performance
- [ ] App response times
- [ ] Database query performance
- [ ] User session handling
- [ ] API endpoint performance

### Phase 4: Edge Case Testing ❌ (Needed)
**Status**: Not Started
**Goal**: Handle unusual scenarios gracefully

#### 4.1 Data Edge Cases
- [ ] Users with no training history
- [ ] Users with corrupted data
- [ ] Users with special characters in data
- [ ] Users with very large datasets

#### 4.2 System Edge Cases
- [ ] Network interruptions during migration
- [ ] Database connection failures
- [ ] Insufficient disk space
- [ ] Memory constraints

### Phase 5: Rollback Testing ❌ (Needed)
**Status**: Not Started
**Goal**: Ensure we can recover from failures

#### 5.1 Rollback Scenarios
- [ ] Migration failure rollback
- [ ] Partial migration rollback
- [ ] Data corruption rollback
- [ ] Performance issue rollback

#### 5.2 Recovery Testing
- [ ] Backup restoration
- [ ] Data consistency after rollback
- [ ] User experience after rollback
- [ ] System stability after rollback
