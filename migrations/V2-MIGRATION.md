BravoBall v2 Migration Progress Summary
🎯 Current Status: Staging Database Setup & Migration Issues
What We Accomplished:
✅ Mental Training Quotes Seeding: Successfully seeded 43 quotes into staging database
✅ V2 Schema Migration: Applied v2 schema changes to staging database
✅ Staging Backend: Running on 99-create branch with correct database connection
✅ Flutter App Configuration: Set to connect to staging environment (appDevCase = 4)
Issues Discovered:
❌ Missing Production Data: Staging database only has quotes (43) but missing all production data
❌ API Endpoint Mismatch: Flutter app calling wrong endpoints
❌ Empty Drill Data: 0 drills in staging (should have 78 from production)
📊 Database State Comparison:
Production Database (bravoballdb):
Users: 3,292 records
Drills: 78 records
Completed Sessions: 913 records
Progress History: 1,742 records
Drill Groups: 125 records
Schema: v1 (missing new v2 columns)
Staging Database (bravoball_staging_db):
Users: 1 record (test user)
Drills: 0 records ← PROBLEM
Mental Training Quotes: 43 records ✅
Completed Sessions: 0 records
Schema: v2 (with new columns/tables)
🛠️ Migration Strategy Identified:
We realized we did the migration in the wrong order:
❌ What We Actually Did:
Created empty staging database
Applied v2 schema migrations to empty database
Seeded mental training quotes
MISSED: Never imported production data
✅ What We Should Do:
Import ALL production data into staging (users, drills, sessions, etc.)
Apply v2 migrations on top of real data
Re-seed quotes if needed
Fix Flutter API endpoints
Test with real user data
🔧 Technical Details:
Backend Endpoints Working:
✅ GET /api/mental-training/quotes (43 quotes returned)
❌ GET /api/drills/guest (404 - wrong endpoint)
❌ POST /api/auth/login (404 - wrong endpoint)
Correct Backend Endpoints:
✅ GET /public/drills/limited (guest drills)
✅ POST /login/ (authentication)

📁 Files Created:
Migration Scripts:
seed_mental_training_quotes.py - Standalone quotes seeding script
2025_07_25_v2_migration_with_seeding.py - Complete v2 migration with automatic quote seeding
production_data_dump.sql - 9.7MB dump of all production data (users, drills, sessions)
Flutter Configuration:
Modified bravoball_flutter/lib/config/app_config.dart:
Set appDevCase = 4 for staging environment
Points to https://bravoball-staging.onrender.com
🚨 Immediate Next Steps:
Import Production Data: Load production_data_dump.sql into staging database
Re-apply v2 Migration: Run migration script on top of production data
Fix Flutter Endpoints: Update API calls to match backend routes
Test Complete Flow: Login, drills, mental training with real user data
🌐 Environment Setup:
Render Services:
Staging Backend: bravoball-staging.onrender.com (99-create branch)
Staging Database: bravoball-staging-db (PostgreSQL 16)
Production Backend: bravoball-backend.onrender.com (main branch)
Production Database: bravoballdb (PostgreSQL, v1 schema)
Flutter App:
Currently pointing to staging environment
Mental training quotes loading successfully
Drills and login failing due to missing data + wrong endpoints
🎯 Goal:
Get App Store submission-ready staging environment with:
✅ All production user data preserved
✅ Full v2 features working (mental training, custom drills, enhanced analytics)
✅ App Store reviewers can test all functionality
✅ Production users unaffected during review process
